##Dynamics CRM Developer Extensions##

**Goal**

The goal of this project is to be a free alternative to the CRM Developer Toolkit that shipped with the Dynamics CRM 2011 & 2013 SDK. Currently it contains project  and item templates to help jump start the development process, code snippets, a tool to search for CRM related MSDN content, and a web resource deployer. The plan is to continue to expand and include other tooling to help streamline Dynamics CRM development. 

Supported versions of Visual Studio include 2012, 2013, & 2015 and will be distributed via the Visual Studio Gallery.

The project and item templates are based on the [SideWaffle](http://sidewaffle.com/) project.
